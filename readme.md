Quark is a desktop application that allows you to search the net instantly. The program itself is bound to a key-binding (specified by the user),
that, when pressed, prompts the user to type their web query and opens that desired query in their default browser. In the future, Quark will also
be able to search the users local content and return results from there as well.

## Dev
To install the Quark source code:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mAzurkovic/quark.git
$ cd quark
$ npm install
```
Then to run the application:
```
$ npm start
```

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

Builds the app for OS X, Linux, and Windows, using [electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager).
